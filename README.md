# Very simple painting experiments (16-bit WinAPI)

This repository contain very simple OpenWatcom project created just to experiment with drawing on Windows using pure 16-bit WinAPI.
It's really nothing very special. ;)

## Important note
**This repository contains very simple experiments only!** If You like to see something more advanced (at least a bit), take a look at my much bigger project called [SimpleNoter](https://github.com/Magnetic-Fox/SimpleNoter). I think it's much more representative. ;)

## What to use to compile this code?

The code provided here was made to compile using Open Watcom IDE, which is quite good for modern MS-DOS/WfW3.11 development.
It's possible that it would compile using old Microsoft compilers, but I haven't tested it. It's best to use Watcom for it.

## Disclaimer

I've made much effort to provide here working and checked codes with hope it will be useful.
**However, these codes are provided here "AS IS", with absolutely no warranty! I take no responsibility for using them - DO IT ON YOUR OWN RISK!**
